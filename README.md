## Overview

_Fire Hydrant is an internal organization web app thatâ€™s a hybrid between an employee directory and social network!_

##### Demo
- Live Version: http://fire-hydrant.surge.sh
- Backend Git repo: https://github.com/SArliss/fire-hydrant-backend
- Backend deployed: https://guarded-sea-27397.herokuapp.com

### Design and Development

Designed by Simone Tobias and 
Michael LoPreto. Developed by Jeremy Taubman and Sinara Arliss.

### The Problem

It's difficult to stay connected with employees, on a personal and professional level, across a large organization with the majority of them working remote.

<br>

## MVP

_The minimum requirement for the fyre hydrant web app is to provide an online portal where users can login/signup for an account and fill their profile info with name, email, password, position, location and fun facts fields. All users can view, create, edit and delete posts about the projects they are working on or something else they want to share with their peers. Also, all users should get the ability to comment on posts._

- Use at least 1 API to call and display information.

<br>

### MVP Goals
- _Users can signin and signup in a safe enviroment (JWT authentication)_
- _Users must be logged in to have access to all the content in the DB (viewing permission)_
- _Users should have the ability to create, read, update and delete their posts_
- _Users should be able to leave comments in posts._
